=========

Some very crude IPC latency benchmarks. Measures one way message passing latency.

 * pipes-busy.c - Measure latency of IPC using busy reading pipes 
 * pipes.c - Measure latency of IPC using pipes
 * pqueues.c - Measure latency of IPC using POSIX message queues
 * pshm.c - Measure latency of IPC using shm and POSIX threads locking primitives
 * queues.c - Measure latency of IPC using SYS V queues
 * shm.c - Measure latency of IPC using shm
 * spair.c - Measure latency of IPC using unix domain sockets 
 * tcp.c - Measure latency of IPC using TCP sockets
